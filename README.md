# Portfolio-Website

This is a simple portfolio website I made that anyone can use as a temple of their own

## Simple Web Project

This is made using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (1 function)

## How to run

I used vscode and used the live server extension to view my webpage prior to deployment
