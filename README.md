# Portfolio-Website

This is a simple portfolio website I made that anyone can use as a temple of their own, I followed a youtube tutorial and added my own svg backgrounds and adjusted some of the stylings

## Simple Web Project:

This is made using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript --> (1 function)

### Notes:
Good example for learning how to make webpages for mobile formats (see mediaqueries.css) & Nav Bars / Hamburger Menus as well

## How to run:

I used vscode and used the live server extension to view my webpage prior to deployment

## How to deploy:

I used netlify to deploy since they make it really simple, plus you can buy a custom domain name + hosting
Could use docker and AWS to deploy as well or however you prefer to deploy node 'servers'
